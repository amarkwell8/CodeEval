This was my submission for the "Fizz Buzz" challenge on codeval.com. For this challenge an argument was accepted that contained a list of 3 integers. The first two of these are dividers and the third is the range of how high the program should count. The program then counted to the third integer and every integer that could be divided evenly by the first integer would result in the consule printing a "F", if the same was true for the second divider a "B" would be printed, and if the integer could be divided by both the dividers "FB" would be printed. If the integer could not be divided evenly by neither the first divider nor the second then the integer itself was printed.
